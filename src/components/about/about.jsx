            ðŸŽ€ A hacker is always creating something new. They put in long
            hours, try a hundred different solutions and ideas, and even fail a
            few times before getting the best result. But, never stop learning
            new things. And the goal of a hackathon is to work together,
            collaborate and build innovative things.{" "}
